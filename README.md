# Project Description

## Introduction
This project involves scraping data from e-commerce websites and storing it in JSON and CSV formats. The scraped data is then read and processed using PySpark to perform various transformations and analyses. The processed data is saved in JSON format and subsequently loaded into a MySQL database for further use and analysis.

## Main Tasks
- **Web Scraping**: Scrape data from e-commerce websites and save it in JSON and CSV formats.
- **Data Processing**: Read the JSON files and process the data using PySpark.
- **Data Storage**: Save the processed data in JSON format.
- **Database Loading**: Load the processed data into a MySQL database for further analysis and utilization.

## Technologies/Languages
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for web scraping and data processing.
- **PySpark**: Used for processing and transforming the data.
- **MySQL**: The database used for storing the processed data.

## Libraries
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping.
- **Requests**: For sending HTTP requests to the websites.
- **PySpark**: For data processing and transformation.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and conversion between JSON and CSV formats.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For interacting with the MySQL database.
